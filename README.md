# The Headgear - A Mental Health Assessment and Aid Application
- A Simple Mental Health Assessment and Aid Application made as the Final Year Project by Daniel Gabrieal Jayarajan in 2019

#Overview
Mental Health has become an important part in a personâ€™s life today. More and more people find it harder to enjoy life as they cannot find a balance between their life activities and find it increasingly difficult to solve their mental health issues as they are kept busy in their daily life. They tend to ignore their mental health and it deteriorates as time passes and evolves into a mental illness such as stress, depression or anxiety. In order to have good mental health, people need assessments and proper aid in order to make changes into their lifestyle and retain a balance. Therefore, a good and fast solution is required to provide these people proper assessment and aid to help them help themselves get a better life.
